Before reporting a new issue please double check that there isn't an existing issue report that matches your issue under https://github.com/michael-schaller/resume-youtube-subs/issues.

If there is an existing issue then please only comment on the issue if you have new details or clarifications to add. Please **do not** add a comment that only states that you are also affected as that only adds noise. If you want to express that you are also affected then please just enable notifications for the issue as you are then listed as participant and the participant count will reflect the affected users. 

If you file a new issue please be aware that the extension can break when YouTube changes the site layout and that these changes are rolled out gradually. This means that if the extension is broken for you that others might not be able to reproduce the issue yet (as they don't see the YouTube changes yet). So **please be patient** in case the extension breaks on YouTube changes.

**New issue template:**

Suggested template for new issue reports. If you want to file a feature request or ask a question feel free to just remove the template.

* Please remove this line and all text above.

* Give an expressive issue title.

  Good example: Extension stopped scrolling down on 2023-12-11  
  Bad example: Shit's broken

* What didn't work as expected?

    Please be as precise as possible. Did you get a specific error message? Did the extension not start to scroll down? Was the extension unable to find the newest watched video? ...?

* Does the issue happen all the time or only occasionally?

    If occasionally please add the frequency. Example: About 1 out of 10 tries.

* Anything additional to add?
